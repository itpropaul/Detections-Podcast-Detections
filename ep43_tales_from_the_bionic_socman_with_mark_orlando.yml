- title: HTTP Header Data Anomalies
  description: >
    Even in today's SSL encrypted world, it's helpful to look at HTTP header data. There is a ton of great information
    and detections that you can get out of that data source. In fact, Jack Crook (with GE-CIRT), was discussing on 
    Twitter about generating statistics for all the different URIs that you see for HTTP POST methods and picking out 
    badness based on deviations.
