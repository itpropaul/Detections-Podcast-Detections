# Detections-Podcast-Detections
Detections podcast detections in structured YAML file format complete with titles, descriptions, timestamps, references, ATT&CK URLs, and ATT&CK tags.

My hope is that this will be a nice trove of detections for security people to use for threat hunting as well as for rules in their SIEMs, EDRs, etc.

The logical next step that one could do is take these formatted detections and contribute new Sigma rules where none exist currently.

I have just done the first episode and it can be used as a template for the others. I and whoever else are moderators will review/accept pull requests for new YAML file submissions.
